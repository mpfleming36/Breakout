Lab 2: Breakout

Screen Size:
	800x600

Controls:
	Up- W or UP
	Down- S or DOWN
	Left- A or LEFT
	Right- D or RIGHT
	Shoot- SPACE
	Restart- R(only if game is over)

Player starts with 3 lives. Scores 1 point per brick broken.
Each life remain counts as 1 point. Max score of 15.

Does not use inheritance. I attempted to start, but was having issues with it.
Plus did not have a lot of extra time. There is one noted "bug" (I kinda like it),
where if the paddle is along the wall at the start of each round and you still hold the
left or right button, the ball will move closer to the wall instead of being centered.
This could easily be fixed, but I started to like it. Did not do exact replica of
breakout because that is not creative.
